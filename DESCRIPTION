Description: In large data sets, classical t-tests often overemphasize statistical
    significance. With hundreds of thousands of observations, even negligible effects
    can yield extremely low p-values, undermining interpretability. This package
    implements the log-adjusted t-statistic, a transformation of the classical
    t-statistic that depends on the degrees of freedom. The method preserves classical
    behavior in small samples but suppresses artificial sensitivity in large samples,
    avoiding misleading significance. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world data show
    that the log-adjusted t-statistic highlights only effects of substantive importance,
    reducing false positives and improving trustworthiness in high-volume analyses.
    The method bridges classical inference and modern big data contexts.
